As a result, it is \r\nnecessary to develop and improve efficiency.   \r\n\u2022 Preprocessing techniques are employed to enhance the quality of input images and \r\nreduce noise. Feature extraction methods are then applied to extract relevant \r\ninformation from the images, and these features are used to train the model.   \r\n\u2022 In conclusion, The  encodings are compared, if the images are same then the encodings \r\nwill also be same and hence no forgery has happened else forgery has happened.  \r\n PERSON DETAILS:    \r\n      Name: Kamarajugadda Deekshitha  \r\n      Father\u2019s Name: Kamarajugadda Venkatasubbarao    \r\nMother\u2019s Name: Kamarajugadda Hymavathi   \r\nGender: Female   \r\nDate of birth :01 -07-2002   \r\nNationality: Indian   \r\nLanguages Known: Telugu,English   \r\nPresent Address: Dno -6-156, Srihari  Gardens, Penamaluru,  Krishna -521137   \r\n      Permanent Address : 6-31, Near Rama layam , Vellaturu , Bapatla \u2013 52225  \r\nPlace: Bapatla    \r\n \r\n                                                                                           Kamarajugadda  Deekshitha  \r\n                                                                                                               Signature     ",

Proficient in\r\nHTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and ReactJS, with a solid understanding of responsive design principles. Skilled in\r\ncreating intuitive user interfaces and experiences, I am eager to apply my academic knowledge and hands-on\r\nproject experience to contribute effectively to dynamic development teams. I am particularly excited about\r\nleveraging my skills in building scalable and engaging web applications that enhance user interaction and\r\nsatisfaction. With a keen focus on mobile responsiveness, I am committed to ensuring seamless user experiences\r\nacross all devices, from desktops to smartphones, utilizing the latest front-end frameworks and design techniques.\r\nReady to collaborate and learn in a fast-paced, innovative environment, I am poised to make a positive impact in\r\nthe field of web development.\r\nTechnical Skills\r\nLanguages : Core Java,Sql\r\nWebTechnologies : HTML5,CSS3,Bootstrap,JavaScript,React\r\nDeveloper Tools : Git\r\nProject\r\nComprehensive Analysis of Detection Of Fake Social Media Accounts\r\n\u2022This integrated approach not only improves detection accuracy but also enables timely response and mitigation,\r\nsafeguarding platforms and users from potential risks. By continuously updating the clusters based on new data\r\nand adjusting IDS parameters to reflect emerging threats, the system can adapt to evolving attack tactics and\r\npatterns. Moreover, the combination of behavioral analysis and network monitoring provides a more holistic view of\r\nuser activities, allowing for a deeper understanding of normal and abnormal behaviors across different dimensions.\r\nThis comprehensive approach not only helps in identifying individual fake accounts but also in uncovering\r\ncoordinated efforts or sophisticated attacks that involve multiple accounts or vectors. As a result, platforms can\r\nproactively implement preventive measures and strengthen their overall security posture against increasingly\r\nsophisticated threats in the digital landscape.\r\nEducation\r\nNalla Malla Reddy Engineering College Hyderabad, India\r\nComputer Science And Engineering 2020 - 2024\r\nCGPA:7.8\r\nGovernment Polytechnic Gadwal, India\r\nComputer Engineering 2018 - 2021\r\nCGPA:8.16\r\nZilla Parishad High Schoo Gadwal, India\r\n2017 - 2018CGPA:7.2\r\nCertifications\r\nDataScience And Full Stack Web Development\r\nIssued May 2023 - Expires May 2023\r\nMobile Application Development\r\nIssued March 2021 - Expires July 2021\r\nPython Fundamentals\r\nIssued June 15 2021",

By continuously updating the clusters based on new data\r\nand adjusting IDS parameters to reflect emerging threats, the system can adapt to evolving attack tactics and\r\npatterns. Moreover, the combination of behavioral analysis and network monitoring provides a more holistic view of\r\nuser activities, allowing for a deeper understanding of normal and abnormal behaviors across different dimensions.\r\nThis comprehensive approach not only helps in identifying individual fake accounts but also in uncovering\r\ncoordinated efforts or sophisticated attacks that involve multiple accounts or vectors. As a result, platforms can\r\nproactively implement preventive measures and strengthen their overall security posture against increasingly\r\nsophisticated threats in the digital landscape.\r\nEducation\r\nNalla Malla Reddy Engineering College Hyderabad, India\r\nComputer Science And Engineering 2021 - 2024\r\nCGPA:7.0\r\nTalla Padmavathi College of Engineering Kazipet, India\r\nElectrical and Electronic Engineering 2018 - 2021\r\nCGPA:6.73\r\nSt.Antony\u2019s High School Bellampalli, India\r\n2017 - 2018CGPA:7.7\r\nCertifications\r\nDataScience And Full Stack Web Development\r\nIssued May 2023 - Expires May 2023\r\nPython Fundamentals\r\nIssued June 15 2021",

With the development of cloud computing, database \r\nowners are motivated to outsource the large size of biometric data and \r\nidentification tasks to the cloud to get rid of the expensive storage and \r\ncomputation costs, which however bring s potential threats to users\u2019 privacy.
